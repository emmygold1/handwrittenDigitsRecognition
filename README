 These are neural network machine learning programs to participate in the kaggle competition of hand-written digits recognition.

All programs are NOT original, as is tranlation into R form from Matlab/Octave form of Coursera machine learning course material by Andrew Ng, Stanford University.

In case of application of these programs, give all credit to Andrew!
