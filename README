 These are neural network machine learning programs to participate in the kaggle competition of hand-written digits recognition.

All programs are NOT original, it is a modification and combination of Coursera machine learning course material by Andrew Ng, Stanford University.

Use mini-batch gradient regression and training error and cross validation error as diagnostic measure.

In case of application of these programs, give all credit to Andrew!

No warranty of correctness!

Programs are still under debugging and optimisation!

Training dataset and test dataset can be download from kaggle.com.

Intended to use same program but in R. Found fmincg is faster. The comparation can be found in compare folder in master branch.
