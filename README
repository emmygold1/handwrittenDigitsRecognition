 These are neural network machine learning programs to participate in the kaggle competition of hand-written digits recognition.

All programs are NOT original, as is tranlation into R form from Matlab/Octave form of Coursera machine learning course material by Andrew Ng, Stanford University.

In case of application of these programs, give all credit to Andrew!

No warranty of correctness!

Programs are still under debugging and optimisation!

Training dataset and test dataset can be download from kaggle.com.
